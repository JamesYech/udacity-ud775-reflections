What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository prepares it to track files and changes.  Git
sets up the folders and logs it needs to track these changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository is the reference or commited set, the working directory is the set that is
currently being modified.  The staging area is where modified files are or changes are
set prior to commiting them to the repository.
